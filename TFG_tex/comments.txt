Lets now search for an approximate independent particle hamiltonian. 
First we will neglect antisymmetry. 
Wave funciont is a product of spin orbitals psik(x) (introduce whats x).
We remove the dependence of n-1 spin orbitals by multiplying from the left and integrating. Then we get (4.10). Note that this ck be done because the wave function is separable.
Now compare the equation with IP hamiltonian and justify IP (comment hartree potential).

Comment on autocoupling.

Ref for hartree

Now introduce the scf and hartree ref.


Introduce the energy
Do the appendix
Introduce again at the end
